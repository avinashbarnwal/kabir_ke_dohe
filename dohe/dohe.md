 ### Questions of life?
- Maan ashant hota hai usko shanti ki aur le jana.
- Maan jatil hota hai usko saral banana.
- Maan andhere mein hota hai usko prakash ki aur le jana.     


### Dohe

- पढ़ि पढ़ि के पत्थर भये, लिखि भये जुईंट। कबीर अन्तर प्रेम का लागी नेक न छींट।।     
Kabir says that by reading and studying he became a stone and by writing he became as hard as a brick, but there was not even a drop of love in his heart, that is, what is the use of this reading and writing when he could not even know the meaning of love.


- shabd ju aisa boliye, man ka aapa khoy. auran ko sheetal kare, aapan ko sukh hoy.     
Kabir says- Speak such a word, in which there is not even an iota of ego, and the person in front of you becomes cheerful and also gives happiness to yourself.


- jhootha sab sansaar hai, kooo na apana meet. raam naam ko jaani le, chalai so bhaujal jeet.           
Kabir says – this world is false and here no one is our own and no one is friend. One who knows the importance of the name of Rama, crosses the ocean of existence. Here only the name of Ram is 'Satya'.

- jo jal baadhe naav mein, ghar mein baadhai daam. donon haath uleechiye, yahee sayaanon kaam.    
Kabir says that if the boat is filled with water and money comes to the house, then pull it out with both hands, that is, do charity and charity with an open heart. This is the identity of intelligent people.

- beta jaaye kya hua, kaha bajaavai thaal. aavan jaavan hoy raha, jyon keedee kee naal.     
Kabir says that on the birth of a son, you played the plate and celebrated happiness. Why this happiness? This coming and going is bound to happen, just like a queue of ants keeps on coming and going.
