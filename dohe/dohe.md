 # Questions of life?
- Maan ashant hota hai usko shanti ki aur le jana.
- Maan jatil hota hai usko saral banana.
- Maan andhere mein hota hai usko prakash ki aur le jana.     


# Dohe

### Love
- पढ़ि पढ़ि के पत्थर भये, लिखि भये जुईंट। कबीर अन्तर प्रेम का लागी नेक न छींट।।     
Kabir says that by reading and studying he became a stone and by writing he became as hard as a brick, but there was not even a drop of love in his heart, that is, what is the use of this reading and writing when he could not even know the meaning of love.

- jab main tha tab guru nahin, ab guru hain main naahin. prem galee ati saankaree, taamen do na samaahin..    
When I had ego, I could not find a Guru and now that I have found a Guru, I do not have ego. Kabir says that the lane of love is so small and narrow that two cannot live together in it i.e. knowledge and ego cannot live together.

### Language
- shabd ju aisa boliye, man ka aapa khoy. auran ko sheetal kare, aapan ko sukh hoy.     
Kabir says- Speak such a word, in which there is not even an iota of ego, and the person in front of you becomes cheerful and also gives happiness to yourself.

- shabd samhaare boliye, shabd ke haath na paanv. ek shabd aushadhi kare, ek shabd kare ghaav.    
Whatever word you take out of your mouth, take it out carefully because words do not have hands and feet. The same word becomes medicine at some places and causes wounds at some places.


- jibhya jin bas mein karee, tin bas kiyo jahaan. nahin to augun upaje, kahi sab sant sujaan.         
The one who has controlled the tongue, has controlled the whole world. The one whose tongue is not under control, thousands of defects arise in his body and mind, wise people say so.

### Wisdm
- jhootha sab sansaar hai, kooo na apana meet. raam naam ko jaani le, chalai so bhaujal jeet.           
Kabir says that this world is false and here no one is our own and no one is friend. One who knows the importance of the name of Rama, crosses the ocean of existence. Here only the name of Ram is 'Satya'.

- beta jaaye kya hua, kaha bajaavai thaal. aavan jaavan hoy raha, jyon keedee kee naal.     
Kabir says that on the birth of a son, you played the plate and celebrated happiness. Why this happiness? This coming and going is bound to happen, just like a queue of ants keeps on coming and going.
- karata tha to kyaun raha, ab kari kyaun pachhataay. bovai ped babool ka, aam kahaan te khaay.   
When you used to do bad deeds and did not understand even after explaining, then why are you regretting now? When you have sown the acacia tree, then from where will you get the sweet taste of mango fruits, that is, you get the fruit according to your deeds.      


### Philanthropy
- jo jal baadhe naav mein, ghar mein baadhai daam. donon haath uleechiye, yahee sayaanon kaam.    
Kabir says that if the boat is filled with water and money comes to the house, then pull it out with both hands, that is, do charity and charity with an open heart. This is the identity of intelligent people.


### Being Successful
- sahaj milai so doodh hai, maangi milai so paani. kahain kabeer vah rakt hai, jaamen ainchaataani.      
Kabir says that which is obtained easily is like milk, that which is obtained on demand is like water and that which is obtained forcefully by hurting someone is like blood.


### Body
- yah tan kaancha kumbh hai, liya phirai the saath. tapaka laaga phuti gaya, kachhoo na aaya haath.      
Kabir says – This body is like a raw earthen pot, which you carry around with you with great interest. When just one stone of Kaal hits, this earthen pot like body explodes and nothing is felt in the hand. It means to say that there is no need to be proud of this body.

### Wealth
- bahut jatan kari keejie, sab phal jaay na saay. kabeer sanchai soom dhan, ant chor lai jaay.      
Kabir says that the wealth accumulated is destroyed in the end. This is the speed of money, like thieves steal the money collected by a miser, that is, that money is of no use to him.

### God
- maala tilak to bhesh hai, raam bhakti kuchh aur. kahain kabeer jin pahiriya, paanchon raakhai thaur..    
Kabir says that wearing garland and applying tilak is just a change of form, it would be called external ostentatiousness only. Ram Bhakti is something else. The one who wears the garland named Ram, he controls his senses and his whole life becomes like Ram.     
- kabeer sumiran saar hai, aur sakal janjaal. aadi ant madhi sodhiya, dooja dekha kaal.
