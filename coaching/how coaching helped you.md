Q. Narrate how coaching has helped you?

Ans.:- Following are the ways coaching has helped me:-

- Improving relationships:- Relationships bring joy to the life and make it meaningful. It has not only helped in the professional world but also in my personal life. It has brought more meaning to the life and seeing things from big picture perspective.
- Managing work-life balance:- We cant out-work and pacing life is very important when working more and working adequately is very tricky. It has helped me find the spots where I can balance out and see things in terms of impact creation.
- Creating more impact:- Learning to let off things that don't matter is very important but also having the cognition of what matters and what does not is equal. It has helped me identify what matters.
- Taking up new challenges:- It has given me more strength to take up new challenges and take the company to next level.
- Staying Curious:- Momentum is the most part of life and being curious is the most important skill in life. I think the day I will be not curious will be the end of my life living it fully.
- Optimizing Joy in life:- We feel joyful when we live our life with purpose and work is the source of purpose for my life. I see that I am doing more purposeful work leading to a joyful life.
